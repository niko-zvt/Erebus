# Quadratic ~~Entertainment~~ Equation

You will have fun entertainment with assembler inserts in pure C code, sleepless nights with a math coprocessor (FPU), diving into floating-point arithmetic, and the light touch of complex roots.

To build and execute in GNU/Linux, use commands 

``` bash
gcc -Wall program.c -o program      # Compile C part
sudo chmod +x program               # Change mode
./program                           # Run
```
or see `Install.sh`

To build and execute in Windows, use commands
``` PowerShell
start /b /w gcc -Wall program.c -o program.exe  # Compile C part
program.exe                                     # Run
```
or see `Install.bat`
