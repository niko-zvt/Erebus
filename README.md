Erebus is a primordial deity, representing the personification of darkness. The repository contains projects in assembler and other "antique languages".

### 0x00 - [Rock, Paper & Scissors](https://github.com/niko-zvt/Erebus/tree/main/Rock-Paper-Scissors)

This is a very simple console game for machines based on processors compatible with the Intel x86 (i386) architecture. The game is delivered for systems based on the Linux kernel.

### 0x01 - [Wirth's Chainlet](https://github.com/niko-zvt/Erebus/tree/main/Wirths-Chainlet)

A terribly stupid implementation of a singly linked list using prehistoric Pascal. There's plenty of room to break everything or shoot yourself in the foot.
